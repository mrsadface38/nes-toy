# NES Toy

## Description

This is a small repo to play with making an NES game. I'm following tutorials 
from [Rob Bryant on a forum I found][1].

Do not expect anything really interesting or cool out of this.

## Building

All of these projects are designed to be built using [Make][2], and run using 
[NESASM][3] and [Mednafen][4]. The general useage is simply to move into the 
directory that holds the section of interest, and run `make run`. See each make 
file for more build options (typically only `clean`).
